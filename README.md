# DeepLearningProject

## Overview
In Additive manufacturing, the metal cubes melted by Laser-Powder Bed Fusion(LPBF) are significantly affected by porosity. This project explores AI algorithms to classify cubes based on their quality, distinguishing between those with minimal porosity and defective ones that exhibit higher pore formation, utilizing the set of optical images captured during the in-situ monitoring process. This project employs the CNN model along with the Random Forest machine learning model to perform the classification. The results are evaluated using metrics including accuracy, loss, precision, Recall, F1 score, and achieving accuracy rates ranging from 90% to 99%.
